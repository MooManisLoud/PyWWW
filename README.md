<font size="7" face="Arial">Thanks for visiting PyWWW / PyDownloader</font>

<font size="4" face="Arial">PyWWW is used for downloading things from the web for a faster download speed and website capping the download speed PyWWW uncappes the download speed</font>

<font size="4" face="Arial">It will ask you what the URL to the download is, the python code goes onto the URL grabbing the file and pulles it into the code and then askes you where to download to a path!</font>

<font size="7" face="Arial">How To Download!</font>

<font size="4" face="Arial">You need to download the requirement pip files to run PyWWW it uses a bunch of things to run properly including using your Keyboard <---- (Coming Soon) has PYGAME, PyInstaller, Pypresence used for Discord RPC  and Pyfiglet what i use for custom fonts!<font>

<font size="4" face="Arial">In the folder where the files are there is a download.bat that is used for downloading the files, if you want to download them here</font>

```python
pip install pyfiglet
pip install pypresence
pip install pyinstaller
pip install keyboard
pip install pygame
pip install requests
```

<font size="7" face="Arial">Pyfiglet Not Working.</font>

<font size="4" face="Arial">It may not work because you may of pip installed it in the wrong path, it needs to be installed using:</font>

(Needs to be PyWWW's path!)

- Command Prompt
- Powershell
